```{r setup}
var1 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
var2 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)

```

```{r a}
df <- data.frame(var1, var2)
m <- lm(var2 ~ var1, df)
summary(m)

```

The slope coefficient for `var1` is -0.01 with standard error 0.03. This is not statistically significant at the 5% significance level (p-value = 0.6).

```{r b}
z_scores <- rep(NA, 100)
for (k in 1:100) {
  var1 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  var2 <- rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)
  fit <- lm(var2 ~ var1)
  se_fit <- sqrt(diag(vcov(m)))
  z_scores[k] <- coef(fit)[2]/se_fit[2]
}

```

`r length(which(z_scores > 2 | z_scores < -2))` of the 100 z-scores are statistically significant.
