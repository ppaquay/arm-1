```{r data}
births <- c(0.4777, 0.4875, 0.4859, 0.4754, 0.4874, 0.4864,
            0.4813, 0.4787, 0.4895, 0.4797, 0.4876, 0.4859,
            0.4857, 0.4907, 0.5010, 0.4903, 0.4860, 0.4911,
            0.4871, 0.4725, 0.4822, 0.4870, 0.4823, 0.4973)

```

```{r a}
# standard deviation of births
observed_sd <- sd(births)
observed_sd

# mean proportion of births
mean_p <- mean(births)
mean_p

# expected standard deviation with constant probability of births
expected_sd <- sqrt((mean_p * (1 - mean_p) / 3900))
expected_sd

```

```{r b}
df <- length(births) - 1
chi_quantiles <- qchisq(c(0.025, 0.975), df)

# 95% confidence interval
round((expected_sd * sqrt(df)) / sqrt(chi_quantiles), 3)

```

Since the observed standard deviation falls within the 95% confidence interval, it's not significantly different from the binomial model.
