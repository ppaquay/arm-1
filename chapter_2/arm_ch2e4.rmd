```{r setup}
mean_height <- function(n, mean, sd) {
  mean(rnorm(n, mean, sd))
}

x <- function() {
  mean_height(100, 69.1, 2.9)
}

y <- function() 
  {mean_height(100, 63.7, 2.7)
}

x_y_diff <- replicate(1000, x() - y())

hist(x_y_diff)

```

The estimated mean of the difference of heights is `r mean(x_y_diff)`, and the estimated standard deviation is `r sd(x_y_diff)`.

The actual mean is `r 69.1 - 63.7`.

The actual standard deviation is `r sqrt((2.9^2/100) + (2.7^2/100))`.
